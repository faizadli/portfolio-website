Place your assets here:

- card.glb (3D model of the card)
- lanyard.png (texture for the band)

Tips:
- You can edit `card.glb` texture using the online editor: https://modelviewer.dev/editor/
- `lanyard.png` can be edited in any image editor.
- In this Next.js project, assets under `public/` are served at `/assets/lanyard/...`.
- After adding files, we can load them via URLs (e.g., `/assets/lanyard/card.glb`).
